Projects page:
Better project card

Project[id]:
Fix the nav bar when ai is activated
Studio doesnt work or diagram doesnt work either 
after finishing i cant unfinish the project (what if i accidentally pressed finish) after finishing the project counters to be moved down and other stuff up 
add preset to counter still doesnt work

patterns page:
the card should be clickable to open the pattern (eye button is a lil too small people expect to click the card)
create pattern form needs a redesign (better looking as in fitting the ui of other app components) and the form also needs a redesign right now its too cluttered and back from create pattern or profile page doesnt work
gonna work on import patterns and voice features later
the widgets on ios doesnt work as well
havent testd on android
on dev build on ios the app crashes as soon as i open projects page
pattern store logo isnt valid so displays ?
lets finish working on the community as well
also when publishing post ask if they want to share pattern or not and how much to charge or something idk mane 
patterns feature dont work still so needs fixing later not now same with voice 


we should start on the backend once we are done with the community tab and fixing all the bugs ive listed for now 

project card should be completely redesigned i dont like the look of it right now
